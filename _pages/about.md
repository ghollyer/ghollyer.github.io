Hello, I am a 3rd year PhD student advised by Eric Stach at Penn. I develop new techniques for characterizing energy materials in the TEM. My projects include ultra-high pressure gas TEM holders, correlative spectroscopy of quantum dots and AI agents for operating microscopes. You can find my CV here.
