I am a second year PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylania where I am advised by Prof. [Eric Stach](https://stachgroup.seas.upenn.edu/). 

My work is predominantly in Transmission Electron Microscopy of catalysts. I am developing an ultra-high-pressure in-situ gas holder for studies of heterogenous catalysts. Additionally, I am developing techniques for TEM of polymers and other beam-sensitive materials as part of the [Soft AE](https://soft-ae.seas.upenn.edu/) program.
